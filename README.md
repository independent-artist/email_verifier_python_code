#EMAIL VERIFIER SYSTEM

This is a python code written to validate emails to reduce bounce rate in email campaigning or mass mailing!

Problem: When the team was running an email campaign, they noticed that some of the mail ids they got from the service provider had errors, which caused a high rate of emails that didn't work. This hurt our company's domain, and the $10K per month cost of email verification was too much for a new business.

Solution: I made a program with Python code to check emails. It takes a list of emails as input and gives a CSV file with True if the email is correct and false if it is not.

Value Addition: By using this system, companies can now verify emails and save about Rs. 2 lac per year.
